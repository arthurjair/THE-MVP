                <br><br>It was a great way to practice teamwork and get a glimpse of how professional projects work.</h1>

                We added guidelines like: <br>
                -Attendance 
                <br>
                -Morning routine

            <h1>>>> Initial branding</h1>
            <p>To find our studio name we let everyone think of names. I had thought of the name “7aces” faces but with a 7, since we were also seven but my group mates read it more like sevenaces. 
                Through discussing wanting to have a clean studio name for example Acne Studio. We ended up going with Ace Studio as our name. 
                <br><br>
                Having Ace in our name, my moodboard that I made had ideas of using card suits for our design. But I didn’t like the theme of card suits. I tried giving a different direction, Ace also being the name of a character from the Anime One Piece and they use Jolly Rogers as flags/brand. I brought up the idea of making one to have as our logo and mascot.
                The design choices we made were more of a black and white color scheme to match with our logo but also having a little of pink to have more of a playful energy. The typography was bold to give off an edgy vibe matching with our logo.

             <br>
              <p> We had to present what we made to our teachers Dirk and Stan. I need to say this was one of my worst presentations ever. I was not professional and had said some things that didn't need to be said. But overall our feedback was mostly on the design itself being very macabre and not fitting our vibe and that the name was used too many times.

              <h1>>>> Rebranding</h1>
              <p>
                I had first asked everyone to make moodboards and rethink studio names. But this time I set a time limit so that we wouldn’t spend as much time as for the first design. While thinking, I thought of the name “Ynot?” as in “why not” I felt like the name was very creative and represented our mindset of “why not? I think we could do it” a open-minded studio to anything. 
                Our look for this second rebrand was more futuristic and experimental. We thought of using a chrome logo. Group members saw this as a trending look. We decided to show Dirk where we were headed with this look but just like the first he said this look didn’t feel like it matched our values. 
                <br><br>We wanted something that represented the name Ynot? Coralie was working on a graffiti design look which we all really liked and and continued to see where we could take it.

                    We liked the idea of a graffiti logo so we tried multiple iterations with different colors and different backgrounds trying to find the right combination to match the energy. We chose the neon-green because we felt like it was giving off “brat” energy which is what we were looking for.
                    A broken down stone wall for the background for the grungy-ness.
                    <br><br>
                    We think this design really fits with the name Ynot? Giving off confident energy of pushing boundaries and taking risks. Which I liked since I was leading this design. I wanted something that would represent us as a team. That especially could set us apart from the others.

                    Another idea I got for a business card was how people use stencils to spray/tag easily which I thought was a cool and different way to make a business card. It would have the YNOT? Stenciled and our information on the card. Meaning you could tag our logo anywhere.

                    We were also tasked to make a short video to represent our studio. I came up with the idea of using the school elevator so that it would be literal “elevator pitch” (i know genius). I am very happy with the result and with the team since I was the director and actor. Nikola as co-star and Lars and Jackie as videographers.
