            <h1>>>> Research</h1>
            <p>The group came together to conduct research. 
                Our main question was: “How might we create a trustworthy, visually appealing, and professional brand that would attract potential customers?”
                 We broke this down into seven sub-questions. I focused on how to market specific services on the website, especially the dental sector, while keeping the broader range of services visible. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My research pointed to five key factors: simplifying messaging, using visuals to connect with visitors, adding social proof to build trust, making actions clear and easy, and optimizing for SEO.

            <p>We also decided to take it to field with it to ask small business the question
                “How could a IT solutions company attract small businesses”
                Me, Coralie and Mayca were put in a group and we interviewed small business owners. This experience gave us valuable insights into their expectations and needs when it comes to IT solutions.

                The conclusion of the field research was put into a persona.
