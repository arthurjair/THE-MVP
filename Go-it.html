            <h1>>>> Research</h1>
            <p>The group came together to conduct research. 
                Our main question was: “How might we create a trustworthy, visually appealing, and professional brand that would attract potential customers?”
                 We broke this down into seven sub-questions. I focused on how to market specific services on the website, especially the dental sector, while keeping the broader range of services visible. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My research pointed to five key factors: simplifying messaging, using visuals to connect with visitors, adding social proof to build trust, making actions clear and easy, and optimizing for SEO.

                 “How could a IT solutions company attract small businesses”
                 Me, Coralie and Mayca were put in a group and we interviewed small business owners. This experience gave us valuable insights into their expectations and needs when it comes to IT solutions.

                 The conclusion of the field research was put into a persona.

              <p>
                Since we were all design students I asked the whole group to make designs for their own work. 
                So I started making my moodboard and since we felt like we had complete freedom I wanted to take a direction of a more creative look while keeping it modern and professional, instead of fully professional to the point it would blend with the other companies. I wanted Go IT to stand out.

                  <h1>>>> Logo V1</h1>
                  <p>
                     For the logo I found the Brdy logo and we used it as inspiration. We liked the pixelated blue design that really matched with my mood board and I saw how Go IT could have a similar look . I showed Coralie and we both started designing the logo.
                     <br><br>
                     Our first design of the logo felt like we were copying the Brdy look and only changing a few things.
                     We decided to try keeping looking but switching it up. I kept making more iterations.
                     <br><br>
                     I liked the blue and black since it gave off the energy of a tech company and it looked professional. I tried many iterations. Pixelating the blue. Blue around the text. But what I made that I really liked was this blue box around the IT. to me it looked like I was selecting the It with my cursor. I really liked the simplicity of the text and the colors with the message behind it. 
                     After feedback from Dirk about contrasting I changed the darkness of the blue to harmonize more.

                    Nikola made a more professional look for the logo and I thought we should test the two logos to see which logo would be preferred.
                   Penny helped me structure the test. Having to logo in between other similar logos and asking my question. <br><br>
                   Which was “Which 3 logos here look visually the best and trustworthy”
                   Testing one version with my logo and Nikolas logo. 
                   And then asking them which of our logos looks the best for an IT company. <br><br>
                   Nikola’s was chosen more times over mine for being more professional while mine being creative.
