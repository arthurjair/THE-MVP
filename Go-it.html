            <h1>>>> Research</h1>
            <p>The group came together to conduct research. 
                Our main question was: “How might we create a trustworthy, visually appealing, and professional brand that would attract potential customers?”
                 We broke this down into seven sub-questions. I focused on how to market specific services on the website, especially the dental sector, while keeping the broader range of services visible. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My research pointed to five key factors: simplifying messaging, using visuals to connect with visitors, adding social proof to build trust, making actions clear and easy, and optimizing for SEO.

                 Me, Coralie and Mayca were put in a group and we interviewed small business owners. This experience gave us valuable insights into their expectations and needs when it comes to IT solutions.

              <p>
                Since we were all design students I asked the whole group to make designs for their own work. 
                So I started making my moodboard and since we felt like we had complete freedom I wanted to take a direction of a more creative look while keeping it modern and professional, instead of fully professional to the point it would blend with the other companies. I wanted Go IT to stand out.

                  <p>
                     For the logo I found the Brdy logo and we used it as inspiration. We liked the pixelated blue design that really matched with my mood board and I saw how Go IT could have a similar look . I showed Coralie and we both started designing the logo.
                     <br><br>
                     Our first design of the logo felt like we were copying the Brdy look and only changing a few things.
                     We decided to try keeping looking but switching it up. I kept making more iterations.
                     <br><br>
                     I liked the blue and black since it gave off the energy of a tech company and it looked professional. I tried many iterations. Pixelating the blue. Blue around the text. But what I made that I really liked was this blue box around the IT. to me it looked like I was selecting the It with my cursor. I really liked the simplicity of the text and the colors with the message behind it. 
                     After feedback from Dirk about contrasting I changed the darkness of the blue to harmonize more.

                    Nikola made a more professional look for the logo and I thought we should test the two logos to see which logo would be preferred.
                   Penny helped me structure the test. Having to logo in between other similar logos and asking my question. <br><br>
                   Which was “Which 3 logos here look visually the best and trustworthy”
                   Testing one version with my logo and Nikolas logo. 
                   And then asking them which of our logos looks the best for an IT company. <br><br>
                   Nikola’s was chosen more times over mine for being more professional while mine being creative.

                    The group decided that my logo and Nikolas were good enough to send to our client to see if he liked the direction we were going.
                    This would be our first product we would send him to start getting to know his taste. Basically to sum it up he didn't understand my logo he said it felt incomplete and sent a few logos he liked. <br><br>
                    From this the group made another round of logos. This time sending him more to see which logo would catch his eye. You know the more the merrier. <br><br>
                    My logos, I tried keeping making them a bit more professional. And I even tried giving more context to the logos I made so that he could see the vision. Sadly in his feedback he didn’t mention anything about my logos. But he liked one that Maxim made so we continued with that one since he liked it.

Jackie,Maxim,coralie and I conducted these user tests after school with teachers and students. We did a few closed card sortings and an open. So that we could differentiate the results between the two.

The blue in the logo would be used in the same way. 
                    My page design was sent along with the others of the group members for his feedback. Sending it I knew he might not like mine as much but the feedback was way different.

                    We put together the elements he liked and I asked the team to come together so we could start finalizing the design and keep moving. I did this because I felt like the team kept swaying around designing and we were not talking about where the places of elements would be or if everyone understood the design. The last thing you'd want everyones pages not to be similar.

                    For this part we let everyone choose a page to design. 
                    I chose the specialization page which turned out great because for the library research I had to research how to market this part. So I got to use my research to make this page. 
                    I even emailed our client so that I could have more information about this service.
                     Elements like visuals, proof of trust, straightforward information, and CTA’s that were all a part of my research I made sure were displayed.
